## Description

This is a simple webpage with a form acting as a quiz. Visitors are able to read a short introduction to the 4 languages they may be suggested. If a visitor would like to take the quiz and get a recommendation, they are required to enter their name and birthday in the form and answer a short series of 4 silly questions. Their answers are used to determine which coding language they should learn. If the visitor fails to enter either a name or a birthday, this will prompt an error message reminding them to fill out the form completely. This page is intended to be a fun quiz rather than a serious recommendation.

| If user selects... | This option for question 5 | Their recommended language is |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------: |
| gorilla or kangaroo | (and) first or second | JavaScript |
| "Are you joking" | (and) fifth | none |
| snakes | (or) third | Python |
| crocodile | (or) fourth | C# |

Otherwise, they will be recommended to learn Ruby.
