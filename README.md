## Description

This is a simple webpage with a form acting as a quiz. Visitors are able to read a short introduction to the 4 languages they may be suggested. If a visitor would like to take the quiz and get a recommendation, they are required to enter their name and birthday in the form and answer a short series of 4 silly questions. Their answers are used to determine which coding language they should learn. If the visitor fails to enter either a name or a birthday, this will prompt an error message reminding them to fill out the form completely. This page is intended to be a fun quiz rather than a serious recommendation.
